I wanted to make my own photobooth I always thought that could be fun and useful and I wanted to add some additional features that will help making the cost down.

What things I wanted:

- Be able to take one or more pictures and make a collage
- Avoid having a printer (liquid gold is ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ and printers break all the time)
- Nice enclosure (spoiler: mine is too heavy, but very cheap ðŸ˜‰)
- Easy to use (no need to explain how it works)
